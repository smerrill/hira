During emergencies, a wealth of information relevant to humanitarian decision makers is available through news media, NGOs reports, social media, meeting minutes, government press release, etc. Unfortunately, this information is not systematically captured and analysed in real time, mainly due to a lack of time. Capturing this information requires manpower and a collaborative, systematic and thorough way of screening all new available information, tagging them by field of interest and storing them in a tabular format to ease further analysis.

The Humanitarian Information Review and Analysis platform was developed to ease the process of data capture and tagging during emergencies and ensuring no important information is missed. It was developed by and for the Digital Humanitarian Network and will hopefully fill an important technological gap in the way humanitarian operators capture and perform secondary data review.

The platform is administered by a group of three organizations, namely DHN, OCHA and ACAPS who are responsible for the appropriate and safe use, maintenance and development of the platform.
