          During emergencies, a wealth of information relevant to humanitarian decision makers is available
          through news media, NGOs reports, social media, meeting minutes, government press release, etc.
          Unfortunately, this information is not systematically captured and analysed in real time, mainly due
          to a lack of time. Capturing this information requires manpower and a collaborative, systematic
          and thorough way of screening all new available information, tagging them by field of interest and
          storing them in a tabular format to ease further analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Humanitarian Information Review and Analysis platform was developed to ease the process
          of data capture and tagging during emergencies and ensuring no important information is missed.
          It was developed by and for the Digital Humanitarian Network and will hopefully fill an important
          technological gap in the way humanitarian operators capture and perform secondary data review.
          </p>
          <p>
          The platform is administered by a group of three organizations, namely DHN, OCHA and ACAPS who
          are responsible for the appropriate and safe use, maintenance and development of the platform.

          <p>This section provides guidance to users on how to use the different menu and options available in
          HIRA to capture information in a similar way across users. In order to use the platform, you need:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One document or one web page opened with the information of interest</li>
            <li>The HIRA platform opened (<a href="http://dnu.lab.oii.me">http://dnu.lab.oii.me</a>) where you are logged in. You can register automatically by clicking the Dont have a user? Click here to register in the main page.</li>

          Source Page
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The sources page provide a detailed list of all source documents currently in the system, with some key metadata (Source, date, URL, etc.).</p>
          <p>The first step in HIRA is to enter the source. The source can be a physical document (PDF, Word doc) in your computer or an extract/excerpt from a webpage or a twitter, etc. Proceed as follow to add a document into HIRA:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click on the <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs">Add Source</button> button</li>
            <li>A blank row appear in the summary table for your new document, with the fields date, type, site, URL, Document and countries to fill:</li>
            <li>Enter the date and the information source name, using the menus</li>
            <li>In case the document is available from internet, enter the URL (copy/paste from your browser).
              The site main URL will automatically be extracted and entered into the “Site” column.</li>
            <li>Click the blue button “Save” <button class="btn btn-primary btn-circle" type="button"><i class="fa fa-save"></i></button></li>
            <li>In case the source is an actual document (PDF, word, excel, etc.), upload the
            document directly into HIRA, clicking on the <button class="btn btn-xs btn-success">Upload Document</button> button</li>
            <li>At this stage, the source document is uploaded into the HIRA platform. Now, one
                document will generally contain multiple observations, paragraphs or sentences
                of interest for you. Each of those excerpts needs to be tagged according to some
                pre-defined topics of interest. To go to the HIRA interface allowing for tagging the
                excerpts, click on the <a type="button"><span class="label label-warning" > 0</span>Add Entry</a> button. Observe that at this stage, no excerpt has been attached to this source, so the number “0” appear at the left of the “Add entry” text.
            </li>
          </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-heading">
          Tagging Page
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>In this window, we have a simple interface where a selected piece of text can receive several tags.
        Proceed as follow to tag appropriately the information:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select/copy from your document or your webpage the piece of information of interest, that will
              be call the “excerpt”. Paste the piece of information into the Excerpt window, i.e.:</li>
          <li>The first step is to enter the location to which the information refer to. You can select the country and an admin level 2 or 3 in the dropdown menu. Location is a mandatory field, at least the  country name should be entered. It is possible to enter multiple locations for a same excerpt, i.e.  if two districts are referenced in the excerpt or if two countries are mentioned. You can delete a location by clicking on the red button at the right of the menus.</li>
          <li>
          You need now to tag the information according to several fields/attributes of interest: the sector(s), the type of information, the response category it refers to, if the excerpt have  reference to vulnerable or affected groups, etc. A pre-defined list for each of those categories is  available in the tab “Definitions”. You have the option to add or remove categories if necessary.  However, it is strongly advised to consult with the administrators before to do so as some of those categories are mutually exclusive and standards in the humanitarian sector.</li>
          <li>Additionally, for each piece of information, the reliability level of the information and the severity of conditions needs to be judged.</li>
          <li>For the purpose of the HIRA, the reliability of information is determined based on the following scale (Adapted from the Canadian Source reliability and Information accuracy rating matrix 2013):
            <ul>
              <li>1. Completely reliable. No doubt of authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency; has a history of complete reliability</li>
              <li>2. Usually reliable. Minor doubt about authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency Has a history of valid information most of the time</li>
              <li>3. Fairly reliable. Doubt of authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency but has provided valid information in the past</li>
              <li>4. Not usually reliable. Significant doubt about authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency but has provided valid information in the past</li>
              <li>5. Unreliable. Lacking in authenticity, trustworthiness, and competency; history of invalid information</li>
              <li>6.Cannot be judged. No basis exists for evaluating the reliability of the information</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Under HIRA, the severity of conditions is based on the following severity scale, designed to categorise the severity of the problems mentioned and the urgency of intervention required.  Severity is defined here as the degree to which an immediate intervention is required to avoid harmful consequences.</li>

            One excerpt might require entering several “lines of tags”. This is particularly the case if the excerpt depict situations with various level of severity. Ultimately, there should be as many lines of tags as there is different degree of severity referred to. I.e. if one excerpt establishes that “Residents face an acute lack of water causing already several fatalities and high level of dehydration, particularly among children and pregnant women, and that access to food for the IDPs remains of concern for the authorities”. This excerpt should be tagged as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>One line of tags for WASH/Water supply, Current problem, children/Pregnant women, severity level 4.
              </li>
              <li>When the tags have been entered, click on the green button at the bottom saying “Save & Add new tags”, in order to be able to enter a new line of tags. Since the excerpt reference a situation of lesser severity in the food sector, we need now to enter a line of tag for Food/ access, Current problem, IDPs, severity level 3:</li>
              <li>At the end of the process and when no further lines of tags are necessary, click on the blue button “Save”. This should bring you back to the Sources menu. From there you can chose either to enter a new entry for the same document (i.e. if another  paragraph need to be captured) or to load a new source in the HIRA and restart the tagging process.
